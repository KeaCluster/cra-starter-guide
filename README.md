# React starter guide

## Updates

1. The last CRA guide is on the [CRA.md](./cra.md) file.
2. This starter guide will move on to using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as its the recommended tech to setup a basic React application with all necesary files and modules.
3. Just a test. There are better guides with better docs out there so don't stick to just this.
