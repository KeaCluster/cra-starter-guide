We're almost at the end of this cruise. So let's continue our journey and get finally get this treasure.

## What is it

[`React Router`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) is another important and very useful library when managing routes inside our application. React adjusts perfectly to SPA but if we're really trying to optimize our app to work as a MPA, `React Router` is a great library that does just that. 

What it does is very simple. Let's say you have an application that on `/` will showcase some projects you've done. This `Home` component showcases the projects, a small description about your company/something else and then some images bellow that will aid the user to have context of your app. The rest of the page, however, has a `navbar`, a `sidebar` and a `footer`. You want these components to be available in every single `page` of the app so we can *actually* reuse our components.
