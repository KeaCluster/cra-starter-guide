## Components

Components in React can be likened to Lego blocks used in building structures. Just as you would assemble various Lego pieces to create a design, components are the building blocks you use to develop a maintainable app. The advantage is, unlike physical Lego pieces where you might run out, in React you can reuse components throughout your app without needing to "buy" or create new ones.

The primary role of components is to simplify the development of both UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience). They achieve this by breaking down the application into smaller, more manageable chunks of code. This modular approach not only facilitates easier development but also makes testing more efficient.

Depending on your application's structure and the atomic design methodology you prefer, typical components might include:

- Inputs, Buttons, Badges, Lists, Tables, Navbar, Alerts, Cards, Tabs, Select inputs, etc...

It's essential to structure your components based on your project's specific requirements.
